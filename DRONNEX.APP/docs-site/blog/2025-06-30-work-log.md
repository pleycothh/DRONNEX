## Current Progress
- Deng FOC V4 board, can rule two motor with Deng FOC V4 library only, limitated to i2c. ( PID adjust required)
- Simple FOC library works in one MOTOR with esp32 only with 2.2.1 library + 2.0.17 ESP32 library. ( some known issue with dual motor, will fix in 2.3.5)
- Simple FOC with STM32-F103 works with encoder only, due to time group issue, i2c will not work simply.

**Failed test:**
- Simple FOC with F411 black pill board: Issue time group

**Issue Found:**
- Simple FOC will pull up (HIGH) PIN13, 14 by default, witch will make STlink fail.
- ESP32 can not work with dual motor on Simple FOC library, known issue, will fix in 2.3.5.
- STM32 other than F103 and G431 not worked yet, need more analysis.


## Final Objective
To be able to have 12 DOF robot with BLDC control, I need cheap, reliaable BLDC FOC module that canble replciate. WIFI on esp32 is not required, also size is too big and no can, leave me STM32 as best option.

I need to test mroe STM32 option, to find best MCU + Encoder + driver conbonation to be reliable and eazy to build also cheap.

I want to fix the module selection, this case code and pid can be replciate easly.

Motor I will decide between 5010 260kv and 5056 140kv, board I will decide between 3 options:
- odrive v3.6 50$ for 2 motors (50A) - Support Odrive, SImpleFOC
- **STM32G431-ESC-1** 30$ for 1 motors (30A) - support SimpleFOC and STM Motor SDK
- Drive Shiled + STM32 G431 15$ for 1 motor (20A) - support SimpleFOC

Build simple project like balance bot or Desk Arm is good for intergrating test with above set up.
- Balance bot (FOC control for 2 motor, PID control)
- 2 leg balance bot  (FOC control for 2 motor, PID control, RC controll, )

## Future Planning

Because currently I stuck on running simple FOC code with ESP32, I need to do more testing, with more valid working case, I can make final decision related to STM32 G4 serial.

- I need stop work on esp32 two motor project untill ( Simple FOC 2.3.5).
- I can start pick up 2 leg bot while wating G4 chip.
- 3 5010 motor arm, greate for 1 leg project.
    - G474 + 3 driver + 3 5010
    - (F103 + driver + 5010) * 3

- need to make decision, is odrive needed?
- Or G431-esc with power shiled, 30A is enough? Need to torque test.

**Decision:**
1. 5010 260kv motor with 10:1 gear: torque output per Amps.
2. 5056 140KV motor with 10:1 gear: torque output per Amps.

if 5010 is enought, 30A drive is enought.

if 5056 50A required, odrive is must have.
