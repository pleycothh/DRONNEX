In warehouses, drones are being used to automate inventory tracking by scanning barcodes on high shelves \u2013 a task traditionally done via forklifts and manual barcode readers. A prime example is Corvus One, an autonomous inventory drone. It carries an array of 14 cameras and an AI-based onboard system that lets it navigate in GPS-denied warehouse aisles and read pallet labels from the air (Startup\u2019s autonomous drones precisely track warehouse inventories | MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Using computer vision, the drone localizes itself among the racks (without needing any external markers or infrastructure) and identifies barcodes on products or QR codes on shelving, associating them with the warehouse database.

Some drones have been prototyped to read instrument panels \u2013 using OCR on onboard video to record meter values, which is far faster than a human doing rounds. These tasks might not require as much AI as other examples; often classical image processing or simple threshold-based alerts are enough, which a Raspberry Pi-level computer could handle. However, as these drones become more autonomous (finding their own way through a factory floor), adding AI for navigation is key. We see some deployments combining SLAM for indoor navigation with specific sensor payloads. The onboard computer thus simultaneously maps the facility (so it knows its location and path) and analyzes sensor data for the monitoring task.

The onboard computer might run point cloud processing to estimate the volume in real time. Likewise, in large oil tanks or pressure vessels, drones (like the aforementioned Elios) fly inside to look for corrosion; their onboard SLAM and lighting systems allow them to operate without GPS or external light. The data (videos, 3D models) is recorded onboard and often also streamed to operators, but initial processing (stabilization, mapping) is done locally to facilitate the mission.\r\nFrom a performance standpoint, industrial applications can vary widely.
