Such a robot might exhibit more reflexive, fluid motions\r\nand be better at reacting to unforeseen events, since its control is distributed and event-driven rather\r\nthan strictly periodic. We are already seeing demonstrations of neuromorphic vision sensors (event\r\ncameras) combined with spiking neural nets to do things like ultra-fast obstacle avoidance in drones,\r\nwhere the entire perception-action loop is conducted with spiking hardware in microseconds.
